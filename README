- Scrisp - Lisp that compiles to Javascript -
 `-=======================================-'

  1. HOW TO USE IT

    $ csc -s utils.scm
    $ csi compiler.scm
    > (compile '(YOUR CODE) (default-names))

    This is not how it actually must be used, however.

  2. WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE

    Language is a Scheme-like Lisp-1. Read the compiler code to figure out
    what is implemented so far.

  3. MACROS? INTERPRETER?

    I hope to make them one day.
